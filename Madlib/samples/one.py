    # if we don’t manage it with our minds, is a society dependent on external factors such\
    # as painkillers, medications, wellness fads, and skyrocketing health costs to fix us.
    # But what if there was another way? What if the answer lay inside of you? What if you held \
    # the key?<br>
    # Most people understand the need to live a healthy lifestyle, even if they don’t \
    # fully understand the impact of their lifestyle choices on disease processes. What \
    # many people don’t recognize is the need for proper mind-management and how it both \
    # supports and sustains a healthy lifestyle.<br>
    # When our thinking is toxic, it can mess up the stress response, which then starts \
    # working against us instead of for us. This, in turn, can make us more vulnerable to \
    # disease, which is why many researchers now believe that toxic stress is responsible for\
    # up to approximately 90 percent of illness, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.\
    # Only 5–10 percent of disease is said to come from genetic factors alone.1\
    
    # Why? When an individual is in a toxic thinking state, the release of stress hormones \
    # such as cortisol and homocysteine can significantly affect the immune system, cardiovascular\
    # system, and neurological system. In fact, excessive stress hormones are so effective at \
    # compromising the immune system that physicians therapeutically provide recipients of organ \
    # transplants with stress hormones to prevent their immune system from rejecting the foreign \
    # implant.\
    
    # Despite a more widespread understanding of the importance of healthy lifestyle choices, \
    # and many incredible resources out there on making good lifestyle choices, many people lack \
    # the necessary mind-management skills they need to apply this knowledge to everyday life. \
    # This isn’t a one-off thing. Mind-management is a skill that needs to be learned; used all\
    # day long, every day; and constantly upgraded as we grow from childhood into adulthood. For \
    # every new experience we need a new set of mind-management tools.") *\
